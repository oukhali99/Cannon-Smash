# Cannon Smash!
You are given various types of cannon ammunition. It's up to you to make good use of them, destroying the obstacles I put in front of you!

Choose the right ammunition for the job and your bank account will quickly fill up. But make a wrong move and you'll find yourself one step closer to bankruptcy.

## Menu screen
I went for a minimalist menu. The cannon spins as you navigate the menu.
